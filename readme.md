GeckoPress is a lightweight but feature rich WordPress theme framework. Basically
it's a simple theme built on Bootstrap and optimized for child templates.

**Please note: GeckoPress is currently in alpha.**

## Key features

The main goal is to provide a simple framework that implements everything you need 
in a basic WordPress theme. You can use this theme as a boilerplate of your own theme.

### YAML 

We like YAML. GeckoPress use YAML files for defining sidebars and nav menus, 
build option pages with OptionTree (built-in), enqueue scripts and styles. 

### Built-In support for the best WordPress plugins

* WooCommerce
* PolyLang
* MetaSlider and RevSlider
* PageBuilder by Siteorigin
* Contact Form 7

### Optimized for child templates 

In GeckoPress, every little thing has it's own file that you can override in your theme.
